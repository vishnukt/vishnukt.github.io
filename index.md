title: Hi! I'm Anjana
---

I suffer from a chronic case of curiosity, which led me from philosophy to English teaching to computational linguistics to software development. As a freelance engineer, educator, and developer relations consultant, these days I split my time between San Francisco and Berlin, though you can often find me traveling (in a mask) to events around the world to speak about the joy of programming and advocate for a more equitable & ethical tech industry. I love nerding out about functional programming & JavaScript, introducing folks to the Recurse Center & Outreachy, and rocking a karaoke mic!
