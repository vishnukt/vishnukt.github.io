<h4>Job adventure</h4>

    <blockquote> <q> <i>
        I began my career as a Backend Software Engineer at an ambitious startup focused on developing a WebApp. Our backend technology of choice was Django, a powerful and reliable framework for web development. Working with Django enabled me to understand the intricacies of backend engineering and lay a strong foundation for my career.<br><br>

As the company evolved, we recognized the need to expand our services to a mobile platform to meet the growing demands of our users. This decision presented an exciting challenge for me as a backend engineer. We made the strategic decision to switch our backend stack to Node.js, a versatile JavaScript runtime, which would enable us to build robust and scalable solutions for our mobile app.<br><br>

Being a core member of the engineering team, I played a significant role in architecting and building the entire backend technology stack from scratch. This involved designing the system architecture, selecting the appropriate frameworks and libraries, and developing the APIs and services required for seamless integration between the mobile app and the server. I embraced the opportunity with enthusiasm, utilizing my expertise in backend engineering and leveraging the power of Node.js to create a scalable and performant backend infrastructure.<br><br>

One of my major contributions to the project was the implementation of a payments system via Razorpay integration. This system was crucial for our business, as it handled over 1 Million Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) per month. Building such a mission-critical feature required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of payment gateways. I collaborated closely with the payments team, integrating the Razorpay API and ensuring secure and reliable transactions for our users.<br><br>

As our user base grew steadily, we faced the challenge of scaling our backend infrastructure. With effective architectural decisions, performance optimizations, and horizontal scaling techniques, we successfully handled the surge in user traffic. From starting with zero users, we achieved a significant milestone of 1 lakh active users, demonstrating the robustness and scalability of our backend systems.<br><br>

Additionally, I took on the responsibility of managing the DevOps aspects of our project. This involved ensuring smooth operations, automating deployment processes, and maintaining a robust CI/CD pipeline. By streamlining the development and deployment workflows, I enabled faster iteration cycles and reduced the time to market for new features and enhancements. This role gave me a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle and provided valuable insights into the operational side of running production systems.<br><br>

After making significant contributions at my first startup, I moved on to join Shopdeck, where I currently serve as a Senior Software Engineer. At Shopdeck, I have shifted my focus to enhancing the efficiency of order documentation processes. I took full ownership of managing labels, invoices, and credit notes by revamping generation workflows to boost speed and reliability. Leveraging my background in backend engineering, I integrated critical third-party solutions such as Unicommerce for seller operations and Razorpay Magic Checkout for seamless payment experiences. These strategic improvements have streamlined operations and significantly elevated system performance and user satisfaction.<br><br>

My journey has been defined by a passion for solving complex challenges and a commitment to building scalable, high-performance systems. As I continue to grow in my career, I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set and experiences to tackle new opportunities and drive innovation in backend engineering.
